# Final Project - The Fighting Mongooses

## Getting the Project Running

1. Clone from GitHub `$ git clone git@github.com:pschulze/seng_401.git`
2. Navigate to the `final_project` folder `$ cd seng_401/final_project`
3. Install all the dependencies `$ composer install`
4. Copy the `.env` file from slack Into the `final_project` folder
    - If you're on Windows, make sure it is still named `.env` and NOT `env`, you may need to do this from a text editor or the command line.
5. Run `$ php artisan serve`
